# Clean-and-Messy-Room-Classification

## Introduction

   A simple Project to identify the Clean and Messy Room.This Project is the Combination of Deep Learning and Django.I have used VGG19 CNN 
architecture and Keras framework to classify the Clean and Messy Room.The Model is trained with input shape (299,299,3),



## The VGG19 Architecture :

   The VGG19 Architecture uses stack of Convolutional Relu and Pooling layers.
