# Clean-and-Messy-Room-Classification

## Introduction
    A simple Project to identify the Clean and Messy Room.This Project is the Combination of Deep Learning and Django.I have used VGG19 CNN 
architecture and Keras framework to classify the Clean and Messy Room.The Model is trained with input shape (299,299,3),
So upload picture of morderate size i.e greater or equal to 299. The Training Accuracy is about 99.83 % and F1 score is about 98.683 %

## The VGG19 Architecture :
